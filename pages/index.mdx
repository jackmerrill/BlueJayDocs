# BlueJay

**BlueJay** is a Ro-Tech provider that strives to provide the best solutions for free.

We get it, Ro-Tech is toxic, overpriced, and underdelivering. We aim to change that. 

## Values

We strive to:
- **Be Transparent.** The best way to gain trust within such a toxic community is to be open about what we do.
- **Be trustworthy.** This means to do the right thing, no matter what.
- **Be open to all ideas.** Listen to the customer, hear what they want. Ideas over hierarchy.
- **Be efficient.** Take your time on things. Don't rush it. Create things with passion, then work out the issues later.
- **Have fun!** What's a start-up without the fun? We want you to enjoy your time working with our products.
