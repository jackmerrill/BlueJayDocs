# Privacy Policy

**Last updated** **July 11, 2021**

At BlueJay, we prioritise and take utmost care of your data and your privacy.

BlueJay is referred to as "we", "our", and "us" to allow proper wording. We refer to the user of our service as "you" and "your".

## What data is collected and why?
To use our services, you must sign up for an account. Registration is done via Discord, which allows us access to the following data:
- your Discord ID,
- your Discord username and discriminator,
- your discord avatar,
- if you have two-factor enabled,
- what private and public flags are on your account,
- if and what type of Nitro you have; and
- what language you have discord set in.

We also use Discord to show you what servers, or "guilds", you are in on Discord. Your servers are fetched locally, and do not leave your computer.

To use our services, you must also verify your Roblox account. We use this to provide our promotion code service, with all requests anonymised and only on Roblox's servers.

When you are paying for services, your credit card information is processed through Stripe. We do not store any of your payment information and only send it to Stripe for processing.

All of this information is used only for the purpose of providing our service and not for any other reasons.

## What data is shared, sold, or transferred?
We do not share, sell, or transfer any data collected with any third parties. Data is stored on OVH in Canada and uses keys OVH's keys.

## Who has access to this data?
Governments or law enforcement may request data from OVH, which we have no control over. We do not respond to government requests, as we do not collect any information that could be traced back to a certain individual that could prove to be relevant in a legal scenario. OVH can access database data at any time, as they have the encryption keys for our databases.

Because you must use Discord to create an account, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://discord.com/privacy) Because you must verify your Roblox account, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004630823)  Payments are processed through Stripe, which means that in the event that you pay for our services, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://stripe.com/privacy)We recommend that you review their privacy policies to undersertand their data polices, as well.

## What if there's a data breach?
In the event of a data breach, we will notify users within 72 hours of us becoming aware of the breach via email.

## How long is data stored and how is it protected?
All data is encrypted using modern, standardised, and secure methods. Emails sent to and from our servers use DKIM, SPF, and secure mail servers to protect both our prviacy and yours, as well as better validate email authenticity. Our sites use HSTS, only use HTTPS, and have strict CSP policies to prevent malicious scripts from being run.
