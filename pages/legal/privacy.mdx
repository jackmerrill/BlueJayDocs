# Privacy Policy

**Last updated** **July 11, 2021**

At BlueJay, we prioritise and take utmost care of your data and your privacy.

BlueJay is referred to as "we", "our", and "us" to allow proper wording. We refer to the user of our service as "you" and "your".

## What data is collected and why?
To use our services, you must sign up for an account. Registration is done via Discord, which allows us access to the following data:
- your Discord ID,
- your Discord username and discriminator,
- your discord avatar,
- if you have two-factor enabled,
- what private and public flags are on your account,
- if and what type of Nitro you have; and
- what language you have discord set in.

We also use Discord to show you what servers, or "guilds", you are in on Discord. Your servers are fetched locally, and do not leave your computer.

To use our services, you must also verify your Roblox account. We use this to provide our promotion code service, with all requests anonymised and only on Roblox's servers.

When you are paying for services, your credit card information is processed through Stripe. We do not store any of your payment information and only send it to Stripe for processing.

All of this information is used only for the purpose of providing our service and not for any other reasons.

When you use our services, we use a self-hosted Umami server. It collects the following information:
- **Page URL—** we use this to see how many times a page has been viewed
- **HTTP referer—** we use this to see how many people are coming from certain websites
- **Browser—** we use this to see what browsers and browser versions are being used
- **Operating system—** we use this to see what operating systems are being used
- **Device type—** we use this to see what kinds of devices are being used (desktop, laptop, mobile)
- **Visitor country—** we use this to get a general idea of where users are from. This is found using the visitor's IP address, which is only used to find said country and then is discarded. It is never stored in our database or logs.

## What data is shared, sold, or transferred?
We do not share, sell, or transfer any data collected with any third parties. Data is stored on OVH in Canada and uses OVH's keys.

## Who has access to this data?
Governments or law enforcement may request data from OVH, Stripe, Vercel, Discord, Roblox, Uberspace, rh-tec, uvensys, or Matt Ronchetto (doamatto) at any time, which we have no control over. OVH can access database data at any time, as they have the encryption keys for our databases. Matt Ronchetto (doamatto) can access analytical data at anytime, as they are the maintainer of and possess the encryption keys for the Uberspace instance. Government or law enforcement requests to any of our subprocessors are out of control, with those entities having their own policies of when to forfeit data over.

We only forfeit information we collect to governments or law enforcement when required to do so by a legal order such as a court order or subpoena.

Because you must use Discord to create an account, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://discord.com/privacy) Because you must verify your Roblox account, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004630823)  Payments are processed through Stripe, which means that in the event that you pay for our services, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://stripe.com/privacy) We recommend that you review their privacy policies to undersertand their data polices, as well.

## What if there's a data breach?
In the event of a data breach, we will notify users within 72 hours of us becoming aware of the breach via our web app.

## How long is data stored and how is it protected?
Data you give to us via Discord and Roblox is stored until you delete your data. Transactions through Stripe are kept up to 3 years after you delete your data to comply with financial regulations in the United States. Analytical data collected with Umami are stored indefinetely.

All data is encrypted using modern, standardised, and secure methods. Emails sent to and from our servers use DKIM, SPF, and secure mail servers to protect both our prviacy and yours, as well as better validate email authenticity. Our sites use HSTS, only use HTTPS, and have strict CSP policies to prevent malicious scripts from being run. We sign DPAs and other privacy agreements to ensure data is handled strictly for the purpose of providing our services with other companies we work with to protect your data. We undergo occasional third-party audits to ensure your data is protected from numerous individuals, organisations, and/or government authorites.

We take appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, hashing and salting to protect the data we store, as well as only use secure methods to configure our servers to prevent data breaches. We do our best to create an environment as secure as possible to protect your data. However, no system is perfect, and we cannot be held responsible if data goes missing because of a misconfiguration, poor setup, or conditions out of our control, such as hijaking via physical access. We encrypt our data with keys that we possess.

## How do I delete or manage my data?
You can manage or delete your data at any time [via the account panel.](https://bluejay.one/app/settings) You cannot delete, nor request deletion, of data from Umami, as there is no way to identify users.

## Data handling for minors
We do not knowingly collect data on users under the age of 16. In the event that we are made aware of someone under this age requirement registers for our service, we take appropriate means to delete that data permanently.

## Where can I find past versions of this policy?
We keep past versions of our policy [here.](https://docs.bluejay.one/history/legal) When changes are made to this policy, we will notify all users via our web app.
