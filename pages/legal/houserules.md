# House Rules

*Last Updated July 20, 2021*
*Roughly inspired by Uberspace's House Rules*

### Introduction

A core value that we believe in at BlueJay is to remain trustworthy and respectful. Although our values and opinions may differ from yours, we are aware of this, and have created these House Rules. These guidelines help our actions while also limiting what we do as a service. We ask that you cooperate and respect these rules.

#### Overview

- Do not use our services for malicious intent.
- Do not attempt to start drama within our various communities.
- Respect others, especially staff members.
- We do not tolerate any kind of threatening behavior such as doxxing, name-calling, and intentional misgendering or deadnaming. 
- We do not tolerate violent right-wing or nationalist propaganda, or any form of right-wing symbolism, or promoting any right-wing ideologies.
- We do not tolerate the spread of misinformation.
- We do not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, misogony, or any other forms of hate speech. 

#### Technical

- Do not use our services for malicious intent.
  - Malicious intent can include:
    - Purposeful harm such as discrimination, bullying, or advocating for the oppression of marginalised groups.
    - An attempt to attack or shut down our systems
    - Misleading or tricking users
- Do not attempt to circumvent, disable, or otherwise interfere with security features of our website.
- Do not make improper use of any support services provided on our website.
- Do not engage in automation of our website without written permission from us. 
- Do not use any information obtained from the website to harass, abuse, or otherwise harm another person.
- Do not attempt to copy or steal any assets or designs from BlueJay in an attempt to pass them off as your own work.
  - You may be inspired from our work or designs, but we ask that you ask us first.
  - If we notice any form of stealing or copying of our designs and/or assets without asking, we will take appropriate actions against the offender.

#### Social

- Do not attempt to start drama within our various communities.
  - These various communities include our Discord server, Roblox community, and any other methods of communication that we utilize.
- Respect others, especially staff members.
  - Going back to one of our core values, we believe that being respectful is the best thing for a person. We ask you to follow this value.
- We do not tolerate any kind of threatening behavior such as doxxing, name-calling, and intentional misgendering or deadnaming.
  - This falls under harassment, and will never be tolerated in our communities. 
- We do not tolerate violent right-wing or nationalist propaganda, or any form of right-wing symbolism, or promoting any right-wing ideologies.
  - These ideologies can include Nazism, "Q-Anon", Facism, White nationalism, Antisemitism, and more.
- We do not tolerate the spread of misinformation.
  - This includes vaccine misinformation, claims of election fraud, or any other forms of misinformation.
- We do not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, misogony, or any other forms of hate speech. 
  - This one is self-explanitory. We don't stand for it.
- Do not disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, BlueJay and/or the website.

### Consequences

If a house rule is broken, the consequence given be based on the severity of the rule broken, and how affected someone or something is afterwards. This is up to the discretion of the staff.

Consequences may vary from a warn to a permanent service blacklist.

We only do the following actions:
- Warn
- Mute
- Kick
- Ban
  - From our Discord server
- Service Blacklist
  - Cannot access our website
